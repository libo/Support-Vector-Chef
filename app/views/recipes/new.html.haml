%h1
  I have made up this new recipe for you

%ul
  - @recipe.ingredients.each do |ingredient|
    %li= ingredient.name

%h2
  - if @recipe.prediction == 0
    I personally believe this is disgusting
  - else
    I believe it's comestible, but I am not an expert of human taste

%h2
  Would you like to eat it?

= form_for @recipe do |f|
  - @recipe.ingredients.each do |ingredient|
    %input{:type=>"hidden", :name=>"recipe[ingredient_ids][]", :value => ingredient.id}
  = f.submit "OK, I can eat it without puking", :name=>"approved"
  = f.submit "No sorry, I really think it's disgusting"
